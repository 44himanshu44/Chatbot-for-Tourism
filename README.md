## How it works
This chatbot recommends you the best package based on your inputs. It remembers your choices and analyses to give you 
the best results. This chatbot is completely rule based however it started with intent classification + entity detection but for optimization
purpose and tailoring to the need of small dataset it was changed to rule based. An alternative approach can also be tried in future based on NLU like generative chatbots
